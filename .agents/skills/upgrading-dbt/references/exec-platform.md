# Execution profile — dbt platform (Studio)

Mechanics for running `upgrading-dbt` inside a Studio develop session. The
rules, the phase order, and when to do each of these live in SKILL.md; this file
only says *how*. If you have a shell, you want `exec-local.md` instead.

## What is different here

**There is no shell.** The skill's `scripts/tools.py` cannot run, and neither can
anything else you might be tempted to shell out to. Every step the script does
locally is done with a Studio tool below.

Three consequences worth stating plainly:

- **`dbt_command` accepts exactly two binaries: `dbt` and `dbt-autofix`.** Nothing
  else is on the allowlist — notably not `dbt-migrate-1x` (see `autofix` below),
  which is why this migration's deterministic fixes are applied by hand here.
- **You write the artifacts yourself** with `edit_file`. No script validates them,
  so the schemas in SKILL.md are the contract — never invent a field, a status
  value, or a phase id.
- **There is no `write_file`.** `edit_file` creates the file when the path does
  not exist, so it is also how you create an artifact for the first time.

Never install anything, and treat `environment_change` issues as advisory edits
only — same rule as local, but here there is not even a mechanism to break it.

## State layout — one file, yours to maintain

All migration state lives in **a single file**, `target/dbt_migration.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-08-13T09:15:00+00:00",
  "steps": [
    { "id": "preflight", "label": "Git preflight",
      "status": "complete", "note": "On branch upgrade/dbt-1.12, clean tree" },
    { "id": "detect", "label": "Detection sweep",
      "status": "in_progress", "note": "12 of 41 issues checked" }
  ],
  "issues": {
    "1_7_003": {
      "automation_type": "agentic",
      "out_of_repo_risk": false,
      "environment_change": false,
      "status": "fixed",
      "files_changed": ["models/marts/customers.sql"],
      "notes": "renamed + rewrote ref"
    }
  }
}
```

`steps` and `issues` carry exactly the records SKILL.md's **Migration state**
section defines — same phase ids, same status values, same fields. Only the
packaging differs: locally these are two script-written files, here they are two
keys in one file you write with `edit_file`.

One file, because you are writing it by hand and nothing checks your work.
Two files can disagree — a phase marked `complete` while its issues still read
`pending` — and reconciling them costs edits you would rather spend on the
migration. This file is also what you read at the end to write the report, so
keeping it whole and current is what makes Step 9 possible.

Refresh `updated_at` on every write. Never rewrite the document wholesale from
memory: read it, change the one record you mean to change, write it back.

## Tools you have

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `load_skill_resource_file` | Read this skill's own files — the issue bundle, this profile |
| `read_file`, `list_directory`, `find_files`, `grep` | Read the project; run detection |
| `edit_file` | Every file change, including creating the artifacts |
| `delete_file` | Remove a file a fix retires |
| `git` (`status`, `branches`, `diff`, `checkout`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `revert`, `merge`) | Preflight, diffs for approval, undo. **No `stash`** |
| `dbt_command`, `dbt_command_status`, `dbt_command_cancel` | The whole verification gate — `dbt parse` → `dbt compile` → `dbt test` → `dbt build`. **Not** the deterministic 1.x → 1.x fixes — `dbt-migrate-1x` is not on this tool's allowlist; see `autofix` below |
| `request_user_input` | Every question you put to the user |
| `get_job_details` | Read one job by id — its `execute_steps` and pinned `dbt_version`. This is how you build `migration_jobs.json` (`jobs-file`) |
| `list_jobs` | Discover this project's jobs, scoped by the `project_id` in your context. This is the first step of `jobs-file` |

**You do not trigger jobs.** `trigger_job_run` is not part of this skill. A job
run executes on the deployment environment's own credentials and its own target
schema, which is very often production — the migration has no business writing
there, and a `schema_override` is a flag you can forget. Verification stays in
this session, on this session's development credentials. See
[`verify-commands`](#verify-commands--the-command-checks).

`$PROJECT` = the project's root. `$ADAPTER` = the adapter type. `$FROM` = the
starting version. `<id>` = an `issue_id` from the bundle.

The **adapter needs no lookup** — it is already in your system prompt as
`dialect`.

## Operations

### `status-init`
`edit_file` on `target/dbt_migration.json`, creating it with all ten phases
present and `pending`, in execution order, and an empty `issues` map. Use the
exact phase ids and status values from SKILL.md's **Migration state** section.

### `status-set`
`edit_file` the same file, changing that one phase's `status` and `note`, and
refreshing `updated_at`. Change one row at a time — do not rewrite the whole
document from memory, or you will drop state you have already recorded.

### `preflight`
`git status` and `git branches`. If the session is on `main`/`master` or the tree
is dirty, `request_user_input` before going further. Create the migration branch
with `git checkout` and `create_if_missing`.

Studio also refuses commits to protected branches, so this is guarded twice —
but do the check anyway; the point is to tell the user before doing work, not to
be caught later.

### `load-bundle`
```
load_skill_resource_file → references/kb_<FROM>_<ADAPTER>.json
```
e.g. `references/kb_1_5_snowflake.json`. Versions are dotless (`1.5` → `1_5`) and
the adapter is `core` when there is none.

This is the whole corpus for this migration — self-contained, with every issue's
`action`, `automation_type`, and `context.detection` / `context.fixing`. The
`kb/` YAML corpus these are compiled from **does not ship in the package**; do
not try to read it.

### `init-results`
`edit_file` the **same** `target/dbt_migration.json`, filling its `issues` map
with one record per issue in the bundle at `status: "pending"`, copying
`automation_type`, `out_of_repo_risk` and `environment_change` straight from the
bundle.

If records are already there, keep the statuses they carry — that is what makes
a run resumable.

### `set-status`
`edit_file` that same file, updating one issue's `status`, `files_changed`, and
`notes` under `issues`. One record at a time, for the same reason as
`status-set`.

### `list-issues`
`read_file` on `target/dbt_migration.json` and filter the `issues` map yourself.
There is no query tool; the file is small enough to read whole.

### `autofix`

`dbt-autofix migrate-1x` is **Not available here.**

**So there is no separate autofix pass in this profile.** Treat every
`detected` issue with `automation_type: deterministic` exactly like an
`agentic` one in Step 5: apply the fix yourself per `context.fixing`, `git
diff` to see what changed, then `set-status` `fixed` — never
`handled-by-autofix`, which claims a tool did it and nothing did here. Skip
Step 4 as its own pass (there is nothing for it to do); fold its issues into
Step 5's work instead, and `status-set` `autofix` = `complete` immediately
with a note saying why (`"no dbt-migrate-1x tool in Studio; N deterministic
issues folded into Step 5"`).

### `set-flag`
`edit_file` on `dbt_project.yml`, adding the flag named in that issue's
`behavior_flag.name` under `flags:` set to `false`.

Add the key if `flags:` already exists rather than replacing the block, and pin
only flags for behaviors detection actually found.

### `parse`
`dbt_command` with `dbt parse`. Poll with `dbt_command_status`.

**This session already runs on the target release track.** The platform sets your
personal version override to the target, and Studio starts or restarts the
development session before handing off to you. Assume the override is applied. You do not need to check the running version,
and you must not try to change it.

What the gate is: the *cheap* check. Run it before `verify-commands`, because it
catches the small mistakes — a bad `ref`, malformed YAML, a config that moved — in
seconds instead of in a `dbt build` that spends warehouse compute to tell you the
same thing. It proves the project **parses**. It cannot prove behaviour; that is
`verify-commands`.

### `jobs-file`

**You create this file here.** No extension ran before you, so unlike the local
profile there is nothing on disk to read — you discover the jobs yourself, then
record your verdicts in it.

1. `list_jobs` for this project. `project_id` is in your context; the account is
   supplied by the tool and is never yours to pass.
2. Keep only the jobs on a **legacy** version — below 1.8. Use each job's own
   pinned version if it has one, otherwise its environment's.
3. For each kept job, `get_job_details` → its `execute_steps`.
4. `edit_file` on `migration_jobs.json` at the **project root** (not under
   `target/`), creating it with one entry per job and one step entry per command,
   every step `status: "pending"` and `updated: null`.
5. Then `edit_file` the same file as you work through the issues, setting each step
   to `ok` / `needs_change` / `manual`.

Set `"source": "platform"`. Do not list an account's other projects, and never
edit or run a job.

The schema is **fixed and shared with the VS Code extension**, which writes the
same file deterministically on the local path: see
[Job commands](../SKILL.md#job-commands--migration_jobsjson) and match it exactly.
Nothing validates it for you here, so that section is the contract — do not add
fields, rename them, or invent status values.

Write it in **Step 2**, before detection, not when the first job-command issue
turns up. Later steps record verdicts against it, so it has to exist whether or
not any out-of-repo issue was found.

This file is for **tracking and reporting only**. `verify-commands` does not read
it — that gate runs a fixed set of commands, listed below. What this file is for
is telling the customer which of their job commands they have to change after
merging. Nothing in this skill edits a job, and nothing in this skill runs one.

### `revert`
`git` `revert` with a `files` list. That undoes those uncommitted changes, which
is what `git restore` does locally. There is no `stash`.

### `report`
`read_file` on `target/dbt_migration.json` and `edit_file` to write
`migration_report.md` from its `issues` map, grouped by outcome, then show it in
chat. Locally a script renders this; here you render it yourself, which is the
reason the state file has to have been kept accurate all the way through.

Cover what changed, which behavior flags were pinned and why, anything left
`manual-required` or `failed`, and — for this environment specifically — **every
environment and job the user still has to flip**, listed together. A partial flip
leaves the project split across release tracks.

For job **commands**, give the count and link `migration_jobs.json` rather than
restating them; that file is the actionable list and a prose copy will drift from
it. Flipping a job's version and fixing its commands are two different jobs of
work — say both.

### `ask`
`request_user_input`. Always `status-set` the current phase to `waiting_input`
**before** asking, with a note saying what you asked, and set it back to
`in_progress` the moment they answer.

### `verify-commands` — the command checks

Platform only. These are the checks above `parse` in SKILL.md's Step 7. `dbt parse`
cannot catch behavior-only changes — connector swaps, quoting, timeout defaults, a
changed materialization default — and those are exactly what breaks after a
version bump. Commands that compile and build can.

Same tool as the parse check: `dbt_command`, polled with `dbt_command_status`.

**The commands are fixed. Run these four, in this order:**

1. `dbt parse` — check 1, already run. Do not repeat it here.
2. `dbt compile`
3. `dbt test`
4. `dbt build`

Stop at the first red. Do not substitute, add or reorder them, and do not take
commands from `migration_jobs.json`.

`dbt deps` first if the project needs its packages. That is setup, not
verification, and it is the one extra command you may run.

Never pass `--target`, `--profile`, or `--profiles-dir`. The session already runs on the signed-in user's own development
credential and schema, which is where these commands are meant to build.

**The loop.** `ask` for approval once, up front, saying that `dbt build` will
materialize the project into the development schema. Then for each command in
order:

1. `dbt_command` with the command, no extra selectors.
2. Poll with `dbt_command_status`. Green → next command.
3. Red → read the node-level errors in the status output, attribute the failure to
   an issue, go back to Step 5 or 6, then re-run Step 7 **from the parse check**.
   Record what you changed in the issue's notes.

When all four are green, go on to Step 8.

**Guardrails:**
- **One command at a time.** Do not fan out; `dbt_command` is per-command anyway
  and concurrent builds into one schema will collide.
- **Max 3 trips round the loop**, then stop. Unlike a job trigger there is no
  per-run approval bounding this, so the cap is what bounds it. Say you hit the
  cap rather than quietly stopping.
- **Never on `main`/`master`** — always the migration branch, same as everything
  else in this skill.

**If you cannot run it** — the user declines, the session has no warehouse
connection, the project's schema generation is not safe to build into — that is a
normal outcome. Report verification as incomplete, retain any parse result, and
make sure the report names **every command left unverified** so the user knows
exactly what was and was not proven.
